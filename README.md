# Longtail Electrocuted
**This project is still in development. More details will be added after completion.**

## Description  
This project uses bluetooth to control DG-LAB 2.0 to do something interesting.  
Longtail created this project to "learn and practice python".  
As we all know, DG-LAB 3.0 released with new features such as socket communication, but we still want to do something with the old 2.0 machine.The reason is simple: Longtail does not have sufficient money to purchase the expensive new machine.  

## Functions
1. Perform Electrocute action when receive specific UDP pack.
2. Generate random waves to Electrocute.

## Special Thanks
DaxieWhite The Administrator of Longtail, supported with code improvement and UDP transfer related functions.
